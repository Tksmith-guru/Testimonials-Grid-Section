			<h1>I received a job offer mid-course,and the subjects I learned were current, if not more so, in the company I joined. I honestly feel I got every penny's worth.</h1>
			<p class="mainp1">"I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I've been looking to make a transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up for the free intro course and found it incredibly fun!. I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12 weeks was the best - and most greuling - time of my life. Since completing the course, I've successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer ar a VR startup."</p>

				<h2 class="min5">Such a life-changing experience. Highly recommended!</h2>
				<p class="mainp5">"Before joining the bootcamp, I've never written a line of code. I needed some structure from professionals who can help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a formed student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint. They were very hnds- on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in  awya that no tutorial could ever have. In fact, I've often reffered to it during interviews as an example of my development experience . It certainly  helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers. 100% recommend!!"</p>
